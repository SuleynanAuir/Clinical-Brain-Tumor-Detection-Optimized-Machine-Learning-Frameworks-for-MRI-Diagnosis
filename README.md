# Clinical Brain Tumor Detection: Optimized Machine Learning Framework Using Basic Python Libraries

## 1. Objective

This project aims to build an optimized machine learning framework for brain tumor detection and diagnosis using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) data. By utilizing only basic Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, this framework improves detection accuracy and assists clinicians in making precise diagnostic decisions.

## 2. Machine Learning Algorithms

The project implements several widely-used classification and prediction algorithms:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A powerful supervised learning algorithm suitable for high-dimensional data. SVM finds the optimal hyperplane to distinguish tumor from non-tumor regions.

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):** A feedforward neural network capable of learning complex nonlinear patterns from MRI images.

- **XGBoost:** An efficient gradient boosting decision tree algorithm, suitable for handling large-scale image features and statistical data.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A simple, intuitive algorithm that classifies data based on proximity to known samples.

- **Logistic Regression:** A classical statistical model for binary classification, used to predict whether a region contains a tumor based on extracted features.

## 3. Image Processing Techniques

The following techniques are implemented to enhance image quality and extract meaningful features:

- **Bilinear and Bicubic Interpolation:**
  - *Bilinear Interpolation:* Estimates new pixel values using weighted averages of four neighboring pixels, commonly used for image resizing.
  - *Bicubic Interpolation:* Uses 16 surrounding pixels for smoother image scaling, preserving critical image quality during preprocessing.

- **Image Rotation and Folding:**
  - *Rotation:* Augments data by rotating images (e.g., 90°, 180°), helping the model learn invariant patterns.
  - *Folding:* Applies horizontal or vertical flipping to enrich data diversity and improve model robustness.

- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG):**
  - Extracts edge and shape information by computing gradient orientation histograms, effective for detecting tumor boundaries and morphological structures.

## 4. Implementation

This project is entirely implemented using basic Python libraries:

- **NumPy:** Efficient handling of multi-dimensional arrays and matrix operations.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis, especially for structured metadata and intermediate results.
- **Matplotlib:** Visualization of MRI images, model performance, and processed image outputs.

## 5. Optimization

Optimization efforts cover multiple areas:

- **Algorithm Tuning:** Hyperparameter optimization, model selection, and cross-validation to enhance accuracy and robustness.
- **Preprocessing Improvements:** Applying interpolation, augmentation (rotation, flipping), and noise reduction to improve data quality.
- **Efficiency Optimization:** Efficient use of data structures and computation to reduce memory usage and improve runtime performance.

## 6. Application Scenarios

This framework is suitable for clinical use cases where MRI data is analyzed for brain tumor detection. Its reliance on basic libraries allows it to be deployed in resource-constrained environments, and it can be easily extended or customized to fit various medical image analysis needs.
